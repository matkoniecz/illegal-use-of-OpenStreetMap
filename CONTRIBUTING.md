Contributions adding examples of major violations are welcome!

Note that here only uses by major entities will be listed - big organizations, large enough that they definitely have enough resources to fix the problem.


Every page should have

- clear statement that what given entity is doing is illegal
- images documenting usage of OpenStreetMap data in violation of its licence (usually it is a missing attribution)
- list of attempts done to fix this

Pull requests can be opened early, but I will merge ones with delay if recent attempt to contact is really rece, to give them time to fix (at least 7 days).
