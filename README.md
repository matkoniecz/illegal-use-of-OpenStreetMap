# OpenStreetMap

OpenStreetMap is a project of mappers who together create map of the world. Created dataset can be used by anyone, for free, for any purpose. There are minimal requirements. Proper attribution is a fundamental one and very easy to fulfill - just mention who provided data that you use.

OpenStreetMap data is used for many purposes, by individuals, in hobby projects, by scientists, governments and megacorporations.

This data was collected by thousands of people with intention of being used and  OpenStreetMap mappers are happy to see that it is happening.

# Large scale plagiarism

Unfortunately in many cases users of this great dataset are not attributing OpenStreetMap at all. They are using OpenStreetMap data illegally, despite that mentioning source of data is not hard. Hiding real source of data is both unethical and illegal.

This project documents companies involved in this kind of plagiarism. The use OpenStreetMap data on a large scale and try to hide this. Smaller entities especially blatant in their plagiarism also may be listed.

Currently following large scale plagiarisms are documented:

- [MAPS.ME](MAPS.ME/MAPS.ME.md) that is using OpenStreetMap data and attributing it to MAPS.ME. It was reported to this company at 2019-07-10
- [Mapbox](Mapbox/Mapbox.md) is not attributing OpenStreetMap on their website. They are informed about this problem since at least 2019-01-09
- [Snapchat](Snapchat/Snapchat.md) failed to  attribute OpenStreetMap in their app. They are informed about this problem since at least 2019-12-23

Goal of this project is to document such persistent copyright violation. It is also documenting that it is not accident. This entities are aware about this and continue with this unethical and illegal practice.

# Wait, there is a hidden attribution

Some behave like hiding attribution in places where no one will see it and behave like it would be acceptable. It is not.

Fortunately, this is also illegal. Note section 4.3 of the [Open Database License](https://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/) used by OpenStreetMap:

> "include
> a notice associated with the Produced Work reasonably calculated to
> make any Person that uses, views, accesses, interacts with, or is
> otherwise exposed to the Produced Work aware that Content was
> obtained from the Database, Derivative Database, or the Database as
> part of a Collective Database, and that it is available under this
> License."

For case where OSM data is directly used to make a map, viewed by user it can be shortened and simplified to

> include a notice associated with the map reasonably calculated to
> make any Person that views the map aware that Content was
> obtained from the Database and that it is available under the
> ODBL License."

Hiding attribution in settings, at the bottom, in "[About MAPS.ME](MAPS.ME/MAPS.ME.md)" entry is not

> reasonably calculated to make any Person

Similarly, attribution hidden by default behind a button is not reasonably calculated to make all people aware of what is the source of data.

# Similar projects

[Lacking proper attribution](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Lacking_proper_attribution) page at the OSM Wiki has a very similar purpose.

Main difference is that this project focuses on documenting cases of especially eggregious, persistent and large scale copyright violations.

In addition, this project is intended to be self-contained and understandable by people unfamiliar with OSM, ODBL or licences.
