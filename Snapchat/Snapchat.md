# Snapchat is using OpenStreetMap data illegally

Snapchat is using OSM data, their map is really pretty and nice. It is cool that apparently OpenStreetMap was the best source. But unfortunately this company failed to properly credit OpenStreetMap mappers.

Snapchat is not source of data used to display this map. They are obligated to make this clear, but failing to fullfil their obligation.

## Reported

I send an [email to Snapchat](mail_to_Snapchat.md) to remind them about licencing obligation and that they are currently commiting a large scale copyright violation. Email was send on 2019-12-23.

[Mapbox report](report_to_Mapbox.md) was send on 2019-12-23 and assigned id 77032 as indicated by an automatic reply.

There is [special form for reporting copyright infringement](https://support.snapchat.com/article/infringement-reporting-about) but it would need to be filled by an official OSMF representative.

On 2020-01-24 I asked also about what kind of date was given as a deadline for Snapchat.

On 2021-02-22 I [reminded](report_to_mapbox_2021.md) Mapbox that they claimed to be doing something about this problem.

## Reaction of the company

Snapchat failed to react, as of 2021-06-20 they continue to use OpenStreetMap data without required atttribution.

Mapbox replied on 2020-01-13 that Mapbox reminded Snapchat about attribution requirements and that they gave Snapchat deadline. Email contained no specific info about the deadline.
